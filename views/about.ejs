            <p>Brain Spark is a collaborative project made by James Fotheringham and Kristin Bell for CS465P (FullStack) taught by Caterina Paun during the Summer quarter 2020 at <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/" target="_blank">Portland State University</a>. This release is not exhaustive, but is meant to show our abilities to collaborate on a full stack project in a limited time span. Brain Spark allows the user to choose a brain path to find different pages that may help them with symptoms of distress. The main point of Brain Spark is that dealing with mental health issues can be exhausting, and if we can leverage web activities to help users find more tools in their toolbox to deal with problems, then a site like Brain Spark is valuable. We also hope to get a dialogue going about mental health and how it isn't just a problem that "other" people face. We all could use a little help now and then.</p></div></section>

                    <div class="persontext"><p>Kristin is a lifelong learner and has been at Portland State University for many years. She has a B.S. in Liberal Studies and is currently majoring in Computer Science, Art History, Graphic Design, English, History, Psychology, Arts & Letters, and Social Science (for now). Her minor areas are Black Studies, German, Medieval Studies, Film Studies, Women's Studies, Economics, and Writing. Kristin started work on a mental health app in her graphic design class, and decided to port it over to CS for this project. She is interested in mental health, because she has schizophrenia and knows how difficult it can be to navigate life with a mental illness. When she's not going to school or battling trolls online, Kristin likes to spend time with her family including her cat Zoey. She also has a bunch of art and sewing projects going on at the same time, and has been active in theater and choir. The Covid pandemic put a halt to some of these activities for now, so she's eagerly awaiting a vaccine so she can get back to singing!</p></div>
