                    <div><p>Kristin is a lifelong learner and has been at Portland State University for many years. She has a B.S. in Liberal Studies and is currently majoring in Computer Science, Art History, Graphic Design, English, History, Psychology, Arts & Letters, and Social Science (for now). Her minor areas are Black Studies, German, Medieval Studies, Film Studies, Women's Studies, Economics, and Writing. Kristin started work on a mental health app in her graphic design class, and decided to port it over to CS for this project. She is interested in mental health, because she has schizophrenia and knows how difficult it can be to navigate life with a mental illness. When she's not going to school or battling trolls online, Kristin likes to spend time with her family including her cat Zoey. She also has a bunch of art and sewing projects going on at the same time, and has been active in theater and choir. The Covid pandemic put a halt to some of these activities for now, so she's eagerly awaiting a vaccine so she can get back to singing!</p></div>
